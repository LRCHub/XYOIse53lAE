Mary, did you know
that your baby boy
Would one day walk on water?
Mary, did you know
that your baby boy
Would save our sons
and daughters?
Did you know that your baby boy
Has come to make you new?
This child that you've delivered
Will soon deliver you
Mary, did you know
that your baby boy
Would give sight to a blind man?
Mary, did you know
that your baby boy
Would calm a storm
with his hands?
Did you know that your baby boy
Has walked where angels trod?
And when you kiss
your little baby
You kiss the face of God
Mary, did you know?
Mary, did you know?
Mary, don't you know?
The blind will see
and the deaf will hear
The dead will live again
The lame will leap,
the dumb will speak
The praises of the lamb
Did you know that your baby boy
Is Lord of all creation?
Mary, did you know
that your baby boy
Would one day rule the nations?
Did you know that your baby boy
Is heaven's perfect Lamb?
This sleeping child
you're holding
Is the great "I Am"
Mary, did you know?
Mary, did you know?
