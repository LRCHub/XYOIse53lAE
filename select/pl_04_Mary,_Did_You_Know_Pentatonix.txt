Mary,
did you know that your baby boy
Would one day walk on water?
Mary,
did you know that your baby boy
Would save our sons
and daughters?
Did you know that your baby boy
Has come to make you new?
This child that you've delivered
Will soon deliver you
Mary,
did you know that your baby boy
Would give sight to a blind man?
Mary,
did you know that your baby boy
Would calm the storm
with his hand?
Did you know that your baby boy
Has walked where angels trod?
And when you kiss
your little baby
You've kissed the face of God
Oh Mary, did you know?
The blind will see
The deaf will hear
The dead will live again
The lame will leap
The dumb will speak
The praises of the lamb
Mary, if you knew how wonderful
for you
That He choose you to bring
To us The King of Kings
God bless you, Mary
Mary,
did you know that your baby boy
Is Lord of all creation?
Mary,
did you know that your baby boy
Will one day rule the nations?
Did you know that your baby boy
Is heaven's Perfect Lamb?
The sleeping child
you're holding
Is the Great I am
Mary, did you know, did you know
He's Lord of all creation?
Did you know, did you know
He's a Ruler of all nations?
He walks where angels trod
He is the Son of God
Oh Mary, did you know,
did you know?
Your baby boy would one day walk
on water
Did you know?
